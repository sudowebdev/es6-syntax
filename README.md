# New ES6 features


## var, let and const

#### Summary
**let** keyword is also called as the **new var** in JS. So, **instead of using var, we can use let** (except in some special cases).  

***Minimize mutable state***:  Always remember this principle. You should use **const** keyword whenever you find no need of re-assigning that variable.  
This simple thing helps a lot while debugging your application.

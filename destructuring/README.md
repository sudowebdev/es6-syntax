# Destructuring

## What is it?
Destructuring is a **new** feature of JavaScript that **allows to break-apart / destructure stuff into variables**. 


## How to use it?
See the example in **destructuring.js**  

## When to use it?
**Common use-case** of destructuring is to **make it easier to deal with options object**.  
*By options object I mean object that you pass in a function which is a single object  that might or might not contain several properties.*  

See the implementation in **use-case.js**
